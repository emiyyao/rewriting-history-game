Brief Elevator Pitch Describing Game:
You’re a student and you just bombed your history exam, so obviously, you’re just going to go back in time to make your wrong answers the truth to get an A.

Game Instructions:
Basic Movement: WAD where W jumps, A goes to the left, and D goes to the right.
Push/Pull: Hold G to push or pull the object that is located in front of you and let go by releasing G.
Break: Press R to break an object.  
Interact: Press Q to interact with items without breaking them.
The game has a main screen, so you should begin the game starting from the “Main Menu” scene.
There isn’t anything specific that you need to set up the game, and you can play the game inside Unity. 
Just make sure that the scale of the game is at 1 so that it doesn’t cut any of the screen by zooming in more.

Available Content:
We have two main levels, main screen, and different transition screens throughout the game.
In the first level, the player will spawn into a spaceship and will change history by making Neil Armstrong sick, thus making Buzz Aldrin the first man to walk on the moon. The player will interact with the NPCs and different objects to achieve this mission.
The second level is set in ancient Egypt where the objective is to make the original design of the sphinx not have a nose, which is achieved by swapping out the architect’s blueprints. Similarly to in the first level, the player will have to perform several actions such as talking with the NPCs and moving different objects in order to switch the blueprints.

While playing the game, there will be multiple cut scenes. It will be used to tell the basic storyline of the game and visually show the progress of the game.

Lessons Learned:
While doing the project, we learned several lessons regarding game development. First, we had the opportunity to learn more about the game engine, Unity, and actually use it to develop an enjoyable game. Although we did use Unity for the tutorial quests, we learned numerous elements that were not covered in the quests while working on this project, such as implementing different actions, interacting with different objects such as the NPCs, and having a storyline in the game to make it more interesting.
One other lesson that we learned through the project was teamwork. The tutorial quests were all individual, so this was the first time to work as a team to create a game. Unlike other CS group projects, the game project has different assets besides the actual code, such as the sprites, objects, and scenes, so we needed to communicate more clearly and frequently with others so that other people can understand and see what we did. So we learned how to work as a team for game development while working on this project, and think that our teamwork got better and better as the project progressed, which led to our interesting and fun game.
Lastly, we also learned the overall basic game development process. For this project, we built the game from scratch, and it taught us how the game development process works. So as our first step, we brainstormed different ideas of which game we are going to make, and after deciding the genre and the storyline, we worked on the design document to organize the overall design of the game. After this, we started to implement the game by dividing work and communicating the progress. So we experienced and learned the basic game development process through the project.
